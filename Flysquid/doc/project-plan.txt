Phase I [ Front end GUI Design and Im. - Preliminary Phase]

1.1 Design Main Window [ toolbar and buttons ]
1.1.1 start stop debug admin and help buttons.
1.1.2 Learn IPC , threads , signals and c/s programming fundamentals.
1.1.3 Create FS server and stop and start that server by creating FS client . [ FS client is gtk callback stuff]
1.1.4 Document the protocol for the FS client/server model.[hacking telnet design ] 
 
1.2 Create 12 sub windows in the same window [From FS admin button ]
1.3 Each sub window has tag name,description,option(s) and 
       arguments to choose.
1.3.1 write callback functions for all sub window options.
[ FS client continued ]
1.4 After that a OK and  CANCEL buttons. That's ALL.






Phase II [ MPI design and Im. - Core Phase ]

 
2.1 Find about the squid internal data structure.
2.2 Create an interface inside squid to run the FS server.
2.3 Insert FS module[server] inside squid.
[ 2.2 along 2.3 is squid patch ]


Phase III [ testing ]
 
3.1 Heavily test the program.

Phase IV [ bug fixing and removing depreciated API ]

4.1 Fix the bugs. Remove depreciated API 

Phase V [ Documentation ]

5.1 Write a flying squid hacker's guide.

[ Look other hacker's guide to see the format - ex: xine HG and Hurd HG]


Phase VI [ Unix source ]

6.1 Create a POSIX compactible source.[with Squid patch ]
      [Using GNU tools ]


Phase VII [ debianize ]

7.1 make a debian package [ both flying squid as well
 as patched squid ][ CONTRIBUTE IT!!!]
 


Happy Hacking.
